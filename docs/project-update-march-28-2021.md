First project update for the year 2021, the software and hardware aspect of the project has been continuously improved.

### Software Updates:

#### The latest updates for the Mobile Application:

The improved UI Screens are completed for the Seantinel Project. The Seantinel Mobile application is essentially a mobile version of the web application. The idea is to keep the system usable with just a smartphone, without needing an internet connection. The Mobile Application is in the middle stages of development, and only needs further feature implementation and testing to get it ready for a field test.

#### The latest updates for the Web Application:

- Bug fixes to improve performance
- Profile image overview of the fishery management area
- Support login, for report approvers
- Support User Management
- Improved UI for displaying location update data

#### 1.) Improved Information about Fishery Management Area

`(Above)` Improvements on the user interface the system can now provide an overview of the area covered by the FMA (Fishery Management Area) of the reported origin. followed by location updates of the report if available. This information is located on the right sidebar containing all the information regarding the report.

#### 2.) Report Confirmation & Verified Users

`(Above)` Overview of the User management system. This shows that the confirmation of reports sent to the system can only be approved by verified users. Verified access can be given to any confirmed member of Maritime Authorities, or corresponding Government and non-Government organizations in the Philippines, that are concerned with monitoring and surveillance of their respective coastal communities.

### Hardware Updates:

Hardware development progress for March 28, 2021:

New form factors are built for the Node and Gateway Devices this image shows two variations of the Gateway devices (the 2 larger devices).

And to meet the requirement of a water-resistant or waterproof enclosure, the device can be fit inside a small sealed food container. This also shows the versatility of the circuit design, as it is small and modular enough to be fit in many recyclable plastic enclosures.

The devices are all battery-powered, in this case, it uses power banks that can easily be recharged. and they can also be powered using Solar Panels.

#### Completed from last target features for software (December 22, 2020)

| Node device               |          Gateway Device           |
| ------------------------- | :-------------------------------: |
| ✅ Solar Power / Charging |     ✅ Solar Power / Charging     |
| ✅ Internal device ID     | ✅ Waterproof / Buoyant Enclosure |
| ✅ Waterproof Enclosure   | ✅ GSM Modules / Transmit Support |

### Testing

As of late no further field test was done on the project, still due to the problems and restrictions posed by the pandemic. So all the progress is focused on the improvement of the software and hardware aspects of the project. On the Next progress update, a field test is still set as a goal. But it will focus on the development of the features of the mobile app, Data persistence, and the performance test of hardware devices.

### Next Steps:

The next steps of the project will focus on the development following features:

#### Hardware:

| Node device      |         Gateway Device         |
| ---------------- | :----------------------------: |
| Performance Test |        Performance Test        |
|                  |   Patrol Device (New device)   |
|                  | GSM Modules / Transmit Support |

#### Software:

| Backend                   |            Web App             |      Mobile App       |
| ------------------------- | :----------------------------: | :-------------------: |
| Support Report Upload     |          Improved UI           | Overall Functionality |
