> **SagiPinas [Sagip Pinas]** is a web platform for Disaster response and risk reduction, through the use of Facebook free data and messenger chatbots. As a way for victims to reach out for help and transmit their location so that rescue authorities could easily locate them, without the relying on full internet access.

### The Problem

**Problem Tackled: Disaster Resilience**

**Background:**

> In the past few months, the Philippines has suffered a series of tragic earthquakes along with strong cyclones which caused landslides and severe flooding in different parts of the country.

### The Solution:

> In an effort to use technology to mitigate the casualties caused by these disasters and to help save more lives, we created **SagiPinas** [Sagip Pinas] a platform that utilizes free data from Facebook and uses it as a bridge to allow victims to quickly reveal their condition and current location without relying on internet connection, in addition users can also read news and advisories from the platform, or see the nearest possible evacuation areas.

### How it works:

- Uses a Facebook messenger chatbot to give and receive information (Evacuation areas, Incident reports), etc. for users.
- Incident reports sent to the messenger chatbot are instantly sent to the admin dashboard used by first responders or rescue authorities, where they can review the report and respond if necessary.

### Features:

- 1.) **No full internet access required** - for the users' end, (victims), the platform uses free data from facebook to operate.
- 2.) **See evacuation areas** Users can also send their current location to see the nearest possible evacuation areas
- 3.) **Get Informed** - Users can also read news and advisories from the platform.
- 4.)**Realtime Interaction** - Uses web sockets for real-time interaction
