An open IoT platform, with real-time data processing that can be used as an independent communication layer to gather reports of illegal fishing and maritime incidents in different municipal waters without fully relying on expensive existing communication infrastructures, such as signal reception and expensive radio equipment.

Seantinel was create as an entry to the first ever Karagathon. A hackathon calling for Technology-based solutions to combat illegal fishing in the philippines.

The event was hosted by:

- Department of Agriculture
- Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources
- DOST-ASTI
- Oceana Philippines
- Karagatan Patrol

### How it works

The system consists of IoT devices forming a mesh network to create a communication layer for patrol authorities to help detect and monitor different maritime events including illegal fishing and accidents.

Devices like nodes and gateways communicate with each other to help transmit the data to the internet, or a base station ready to record and analayze the report.
