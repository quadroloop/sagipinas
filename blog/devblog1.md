First Development blog for the Seantinel project!

I've been working on this project since August 2020. Learned a lot of things in the process about IoT, Mapbox, and other cool technologies.

In March 2021, the project was selected for the YSEALI Marine Accelerator Program. Where I learned a lot of things about the different ways to run and sustain the future steps of the project.

It was such an honor for the project to be selected for the YSEALI MAP program, it was one of 32 initiatives across 11 countries from southeast Asia. I learned so much from the project that I'm happy enough just to finish it and take my learnings with me. Winning the grant would just be a bonus to the entire experience. :)

I'm looking forward to putting more work done in the project and eventually being able to run a pilot test when the pandemic restrictions are lifted. (hopefully, the pandemic ends soon).
