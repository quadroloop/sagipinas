Welcome to this blog. This blog is created with [**Docusaurus 2 alpha**](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).
This is a major upgrade over the old project website which served more like a lading page. this time, with the use
of the excellent docusaurus v2, the documentation of the project can easily be located within the website as well.

There is a set of new updates for the project. the focus will be the use of **IoT (Internet of Things) Technology** to create low power and but long range
emergency networks to allow areas to communicate, in the event of a disaster.
