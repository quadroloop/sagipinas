> __SagiPinas [Sagip Pinas]__ is  web platform for Disaster response and risk reduction, through the use of  Facebook free data and messenger chatbots. As a way for victims to reach out for help and transmit their location so that rescue authorities could easily locate them, without the relying on full internet access.

### The Problem
__Problem Tackled: Disaster Resilience__

__Background:__
> In the past few months the Philippines has suffered a series of tragic earthquakes along with strong cyclones which causeed landslides and severe flooding in different parts of the country.

### The Solution:

> In an effort to use technology to mitigate the casualities caused by these disasters and to help save more lives, we created __SagiPinas__ [Sagip Pinas] a platform that utilizes free data from Facebook and uses it as a bridge to allow victims to quickly reveal their condition and current location without relying on internet connection, in addtion users can also read news and adisories from the platform, or see the nearest possible evacuation areas.

### How it works:
 - Uses a Facebook messenger chatbot to give and recieve information (Evacuation areas, Incident reports) etc. for users.
 - Incident reports sent to the messenger chatbot are instantly sent to the admin dashboard used by first responders or rescue authorieties, where they can review the report and respond if necessary.

### Features:
1.) __No full internet access required__ - for the users end, (victims), the platform uses free data from facebook to operate.
2.) __See evacuation areas__ Users can also send their current location to see the nearest possible evaucation areas
3.) __Get Informed__ - Users can also read news and advisories from the platform.
4.)__Realtime Interaction__ - Uses web sockets for real time interaction
